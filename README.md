## Overview

Traditional quantum simulation methods scale exponentially with dimension, making high-dimensional problems intractable. DSM addresses this fundamental limitation by:


- **Adaptive Dimensionality**: Leveraging the latent low-dimensional structure of wave functions
- **Markovian Sampling**: Using diffusion-based sampling to avoid MCMC samoling for every time step
- **Novel Stochastic Framework**: Introducing new equations for stochastic quantum mechanics with quadratic computational complexity
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Combining insights from generative diffusion models with quantum simulation

It leads to significant computational advantages for high-dimensional quantum systems.

üìÅ notebooks/              # Experimental notebooks and demonstrations
```

### Code Organization

#### `interacting-system/`
Implementation for **interacting bosons in a harmonic oscillator** with `torch.jit` optimization for enhanced performance.

#### `non-interacting-system/`
Implementation for **non-interacting bosons in a harmonic oscillator** with `torch.jit` optimization.

#### `notebooks/`
Jupyter notebooks containing experimental code and demonstrations. Note: These notebooks use the standard PyTorch implementation without `torch.jit` optimization for better readability and experimentation.

## üî¨ Methodology

DSM reformulates quantum dynamics through stochastic differential equations, allowing neural networks to learn from particle trajectories rather than gridded wave functions. This approach:

- Samples trajectories from Markovian diffusion processes
- Learns dynamics via deep neural networks
- Scales favorably by adapting to intrinsic dimensionality
- Bridges generative AI and quantum simulation

## üìä Performance

Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speedup over existing deep learning quantum methods while maintaining accuracy across different system configurations and dimensions.
