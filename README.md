## Overview

Traditional numerical methods for quantum mechanics suffer from exponential scaling with problem dimension. DSM addresses this fundamental limitation by:

- **Adaptive Dimensionality**: Leveraging the latent low-dimensional structure of wave functions
- **Markovian Sampling**: Using diffusion-based sampling to avoid MCMC samoling for every time step
- **Novel Stochastic Framework**: Introducing new equations for stochastic quantum mechanics with quadratic computational complexity
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Combining insights from generative diffusion models with quantum simulation

### Key Advantages
- Computational complexity that scales with latent dimension rather than full problem dimension
- Quadratic scaling with respect to number of dimensions (vs. exponential in traditional numerical methods)
- Significant performance improvements over existing deep learning approaches for quantum mechanics

```

### Code Organization

#### `interacting-system/`
Implementation for **interacting bosons in a harmonic oscillator** with `torch.jit` optimization for enhanced performance.

#### `non-interacting-system/`
Implementation for **non-interacting bosons in a harmonic oscillator** with `torch.jit` optimization.

#### `notebooks/`
Jupyter notebooks containing experimental code and demonstrations. Note: These notebooks use the standard PyTorch implementation without `torch.jit` optimization for better readability and experimentation.
